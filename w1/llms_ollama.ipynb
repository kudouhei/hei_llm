      "To analyze the code and identify potential DOM event sequences that may be causing flaky failures, I'll need to simulate different scenarios and run the code multiple times. Here's a possible approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Simulate Different Scenarios:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Generate random user inputs (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).\n",
      "    *   Vary the timing of these events (e.g., delay between clicks or submissions).\n",
      "    *   Run the application multiple times with different input scenarios.\n",
      "2.  **Analyze DOM Event Sequences and Responses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Use a tool like Chrome DevTools to inspect the DOM events sequence and responses in each scenario.\n",
      "    *   Identify any patterns or correlations between specific DOM events and responses that may be contributing to flakiness.\n",
      "3.  **Run Multiple Iterations and Analyze Results:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Repeat steps 1-2 multiple times (e.g., 5 times) to generate a diverse set of data.\n",
      "    *   Analyze the results across all iterations to identify recurring patterns or suspicious DOM event pairs.\n",
